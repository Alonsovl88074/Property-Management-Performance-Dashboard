### Property Management Performance Dashboard (Simulated Data)

**Project Goal:** To develop a comprehensive Business Intelligence dashboard for Property Management (PM) companies to track key operational and financial performance metrics, inspired by the business model and publicly available metrics of the most relevant properties managements consulting solutions.

**Role:** Independent BI Consultant / Data Analyst

**Project Overview:**
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a BI solution, starting from understanding business requirements to designing the data model, developing key performance indicators (KPIs) using DAX, and creating interactive dashboards for data-driven insights. The project simulates data based on the core operational workflows and financial metrics relevant to property management businesses, as identified through research and analysis of industry best practices.

**Key Objectives Achieved:**

*   **Requirements Analysis:** Researched and defined key operational processes (e.g., Leasing, Turnover, Work Orders) and performance metrics based on business goals.
*   **Data Modeling:** Designed a relational data model representing core PM entities (Properties, Units, Leases, Work Orders, Applications, etc.) and their relationships.
*   **DAX Measure Development:** Created detailed DAX measures to quantify defined performance metrics (e.g., process speeds, conversion rates, financial performance).
*   **Dashboard Design:** Developed intuitive and interactive Power BI dashboards organized by functional area to visualize performance, identify trends, and highlight areas for improvement.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Business Understanding:** Analyzed the core operations and value proposition of a data-driven PM consulting model
2.  **Data Structure Conceptualization:** Defined the necessary data entities and proposed a relational schema required to support the identified metrics. Simulated data in CSV format based on this schema.
3.  **Power BI Data Modeling:** Imported simulated data, cleaned data types, and established relationships between tables in Power BI Desktop.
4.  **DAX KPI Calculation:** Developed DAX measures using appropriate functions (`DATEDIFF`, `COUNTROWS`, `FILTER`, `AVERAGEX`, `CALCULATE`, etc.) to compute process speeds, rates, counts, and financial summaries.
5.  **Report & Dashboard Creation:** Organized measures and data into logical pages (dashboards) focusing on different aspects of PM performance (Executive Summary, Leasing, Maintenance, Turnover, Financial Snapshot) using a variety of Power BI visualizations.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

*   Business Intelligence (BI)
*   Data Analysis
*   Data Modeling (Star Schema/Relational)
*   DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
*   Data Visualization
*   Requirements Gathering (from business context/documentation)
*   Power BI Desktop

**Deliverables:**

*   Conceptual Data Model Design
*   Simulated Dataset (CSV files based on defined structure)
*   Power BI .pbix file containing:
    *   Data Model
    *   Developed DAX Measures
    *   Interactive Dashboards (Executive Summary, Leasing, Maintenance, Turnover, Financial)
